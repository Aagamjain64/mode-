 Conclusion:

 The linear regression model effectively predicts salary based on years of experience.
 The model's performance metrics (MAE, MSE, R-squared) indicate a good fit to the data,
 although further model evaluation and potential feature engineering could be explored.
 The visualization of actual vs. predicted salary values reinforces the model's accuracy.  
 The interactive prediction functionality allows users to input years of experience
 and obtain an estimated salary.  Potential improvements could include handling outliers, exploring non-linear relationships, and
 expanding the feature set to enhance prediction accuracy.
